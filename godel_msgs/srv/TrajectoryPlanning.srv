# Trajectory Planning Service
# This service makes a request to the centralized path planner
# to calculate a robot joint trajectory that achieves the
# plan set out in 'path'.

# The cartesian points representing path to be processed
ProcessPath path

# MoveIt group name associated with this plan (see the associated SRDF)
string group_name

# Frames of reference for planning
string tool_frame
string world_frame

# Process type; True for blending path; False for line scanner pass
# Dictates the constraints put on the tool.
bool is_blending_path

# If true, the planner will attempt to create a joint motion from the 
# 'current' robot joint state to the first point in the process path.
bool plan_from_current_position 

# How finely to search unconstrained angles, if any
float64 angle_discretization

# Timing data
float64 tcp_speed   # Linear tool speed (m/s)
