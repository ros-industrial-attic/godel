## Godel

Application for demonstrating surface blending with ROS.

Godel: Austrian logician and mathematician http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del

### Installation

- Install [wstool](http://wiki.ros.org/wstool) in order manage the repos inside the workspace
  ```
  sudo apt install python-wstool
  ```

- Cd into the 'src' directory of your catkin workspace and run the following:
  ```
  wstool init . 
  wstool merge https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/godel/raw/kinetic-devel/godel.rosinstall
  wstool update
  rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src
  cd ..
  catkin_make
  ```

- If you have issues regarding a missing `QD` library, then:
  ```
  sudo apt install libqd-dev
  ```

### Applications

- Run blending demo in full simulation mode (simulated robot and sensor)
  ```
  roslaunch godel_irb2400_support irb2400_blending.launch
  ```

- Run blending demo in robot simulation mode (simulated robot and real sensor data)
  ```
  roslaunch godel_irb2400_support irb2400_blending.launch sim_sensor:=false
  ```

- Run blending demo in sensor simulation mode (real robot and simulated sensor)
  ```
  roslaunch godel_irb2400_support irb2400_blending.launch sim_robot:=false robot_ip:=[robot ip]
  ```

- Run blending demo in full real mode
  ```
  roslaunch godel_irb2400_support irb2400_blending.launch sim_sensor:=false 
  sim_robot:=false robot_ip:=[robot ip]
  ```

- Bring up Kinect2 sensor, if available:
  ```
  roslaunch godel_surface_detection kinect2.launch
  ```

### Calibration
This section contains instructions for performing extrinsic calibration of a camera (on the robot end effector) to the robot arm. This is only necessary if you are running on real hardware with the real sensor.

- Extrinsic calibration routines depend on the [industrial_calibration](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_calibration) package. Clone this package to your workspace.

- The industrial calibration library builds against `libceres`, an optimization library, whose installation instructions are available [here](http://ceres-solver.org/building.html).
